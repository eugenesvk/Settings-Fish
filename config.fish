# Use function as aliase

  #NB!
  #Always take care to add the $argv variable to the list of parameters to the wrapped command. This makes sure that if the   user specifies any additional parameters to the function, they are passed on to the underlying command.
  #If the alias has the same name as the aliased command, it is necessary to refix the call to the program with command in  order to tell fish that the unction should not call itself, but rather a command with the same name. ailing to do so will  cause infinite recursion bugs.

#STYLE EXAMPLE DESCRIPTION
  #Style      Example                                     Description
  #Unquoted   set world earth;                            Supports all types of parameter expansion,
  #           echo hello $world prints "hello earth"      including C-style backslash expansion, etc.
  #single     set world earth;                            No parameter expansion is performed, the only
  #           echo 'hello $world' prints "hello $world"   special character is the ' (single quote).
  #Double     set world earth;                            Only variable expansion is performed.
  #           echo "hello $world" prints "hello earth"    Expanded variable arrays only result in a single argument.

#The short summary is that if $VAR is not set, then test -n $VAR is equivalent to test -n, and POSIX requires that we just check if that one argument (the -n) is not null.
  #1. if test -n "$SSH_CLIENT" # You can fix it by quoting, which forces an argument even if it's empty:
  #2. test -n (EXPRESSION; or echo "")
  #3. use count
# fish_add_path -g '/usr/local/opt/node@14/bin'
  # fish_add_path: This is meant to be the easy one-stop shop to adding stuff to $PATH.
  # Components are normalized by realpath. This means that trailing slashes are ignored and relative paths are made absolute (but symlinks are not resolved). If a component already exists, it is not added again and stays in the same place unless the --move switch is given
  # By default it'll prepend the given paths to a universal $fish_user_paths, excluding the already-included ones.
  # can be executed once in an interactive session, or stuffed in config.fish, and it will do The Right Thing
    # -p --prepend  	[def] add to the front of the variable
    # -a --append   	add to the end of the variable
    # -g --global   	use a global    $fish_user_paths
    # -U --universal	[def] use a universal $fish_user_paths
    # -P --path     	use $PATH directly
    # -m --move     	move already existing components to the place they would be added - by default they would be left in place and not added again
    # -v --verbose  	print the set command used
    # -n --dry-run  	print the set command that would be used without executing it
